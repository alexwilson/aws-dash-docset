                     <p>You can combine these lifecycle actions to manage an object&apos;s complete
                        lifecycle.
                        
                        For example, suppose that the objects you create have a well-defined lifecycle.
                        Initially, the objects are frequently accessed for a period of 30 days. Then,
                        objects are infrequently accessed for up to 90 days. After that, the objects are
                        no longer needed, so you might choose to archive or delete them. In this
                        scenario, you can create a lifecycle rule in which you specify the initial
                        transition action to STANDARD_IA (or ONEZONE_IA) storage, another transition
                        action to GLACIER storage for archiving, and an expiration action. As you move
                        the objects from one storage class to another, you save on storage cost. For
                        more information about cost considerations, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.

                        <p>You can&apos;t specify a single lifecycle rule for both STANDARD_IA (or
                           ONEZONE_IA) and GLACIER transitions when the GLACIER transition occurs less
                           than 30 days after the STANDARD_IA (or ONEZONE_IA) transition. That&apos;s
                           because there is a minimum 30-day storage charge associated with STANDARD_IA
                           and ONEZONE_IA storage classes. The same 30-day minimum applies when you
                           specify a transition from STANDARD_IA storage to ONEZONE_IA storage. You can
                           specify two rules to accomplish this, but you pay minimum storage charges.

                                 Deleting data that is archived to Amazon Glacier is free if the objects you
                                 delete are archived for three months or longer. If you delete or
                                 overwrite an object within three months of archiving it, Amazon S3
                                 charges a prorated early deletion fee.

                        Amazon S3 transitions these objects asynchronously. There might be a delay
                        between the transition date in the lifecycle configuration rule and the date
                        of the physical transition. You are charged Amazon Glacier prices based on the
                        transition date specified in the rule.

                        storage class remains GLACIER (a GET or HEAD request will return
                        <code class="code">GLACIER</code> as the storage class).

                           (GLACIER rate) and a copy you restored temporarily (REDUCED_REDUNDANCY
                           storage rate). For information about pricing, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/s3/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon S3 Pricing</a>.
