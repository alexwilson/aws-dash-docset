                                    <p>Amazon S3 now supports server-side encryption using customer-provided
                                       							encryption keys (SSE-C). Server-side encryption enables you to request
                                       							Amazon S3 to encrypt your data at rest. When using SSE-C, Amazon S3 encrypts
                                       your
                                       							objects with the custom encryption keys that you provide. Since Amazon S3
                                       							performs the encryption for you, you get the benefits of using your own
                                       							encryption keys without the cost of writing or executing your own
                                       							encryption code.

                                    <p>Amazon S3 now supports server-side encryption. It enables you to request
                                       							Amazon S3 to encrypt your data at rest, that is, encrypt your object data
                                       							when Amazon S3 writes your data to disks in its data centers. In
                                       							addition to REST API updates, the AWS SDK for Java and .NET provide necessary
                                       							functionality to request server-side encryption. You can also request
                                       							server-side encryption when uploading objects using AWS Management
                                       							Console. To learn more about data encryption, go to <a href="./AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingEncryption.html" target="_blank">Using Data

                                       							(e.g., <code class="code">http://mywebsite.com/subfolder</code>) returns your index

                                       							encountered, Amazon S3 returns your custom error message instead of an Amazon
                                       S3
