                     <p>By using Amazon S3 analytics <em>storage class analysis</em> you can analyze storage
                        access patterns to help you decide when to transition the right data to the right
                        storage class.
                        This new Amazon S3 analytics feature observes data access patterns to help you determine
                        when to
                        transition less frequently accessed STANDARD storage to the STANDARD_IA (IA, for infrequent
                        access) storage class. For more information about storage classes, see <a href="storage-class-intro.html">Storage Classes</a>.
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>After storage class analysis observes the infrequent access patterns of a filtered
                        set of
                        data over a period of time, you can use the analysis results to help you improve your
                        lifecycle
                        policies. You can configure storage class analysis to analyze all the objects in a
                        bucket. Or,
                        you can configure filters to group objects together for analysis by common prefix
                        (that is, objects
                        that have names that begin with a common string), by object tags, or by both prefix
                        and tags. You&apos;ll most
                        likely find that filtering by object groups is the best way to benefit from storage
                        class
                        analysis. 
                     </p>
                     <div class="aws-note">
                        <p class="aws-note">Important</p>
                        <p>Storage class analysis does not give recommendations for transitions to the ONEZONE_IA
                           or GLACIER
                           storage classes.
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <p>You can have multiple storage class analysis filters per bucket, up to 1,000, and
                        will
                        receive a separate analysis for each filter. Multiple filter configurations allow
                        you analyze
                        specific groups of objects to improve your lifecycle policies that transition objects
                        to
                        STANDARD_IA. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Storage class analysis shows storage usage visualizations in the Amazon S3 console
                        that are
                        updated daily. The storage usage data can also be exported daily to a file in an S3
                        bucket. You
                        can open the exported usage report file in a spreadsheet application or use it with
                        the business
                        intelligence tools of your choice such as Amazon QuickSight.

                        filters you configure. When using the Amazon S3 console you can choose the export
                        report option
                        when you create a filter. When selecting data export you specify a destination bucket

                        destination bucket in a different account. The destination bucket must be in the same

                        as the bucket that you configure to be analyzed.

                        in
                        the defined location. For an example policy, see <a href="example-bucket-policies.html#example-bucket-policies-use-case-9">Granting Permissions for Amazon S3 Inventory and
