                     <p>Amazon S3 has a simple web services interface that you can use to store and retrieve
                        			any amount of data, at any time, from anywhere on the web.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>This guide describes how you send requests to create buckets, store and retrieve your
                        
                        			objects, and manage permissions on your resources. The guide also describes access
                        
                        			control and the authentication process. Access control defines who can access objects
                        
                        			and buckets within Amazon S3, and the type of access (e.g., READ and WRITE). The
                        
                        			authentication process verifies the identity of a user who is trying to access
                        Amazon 
                        			Web Services (AWS).

                        Amazon S3
                        			effectively. They are presented in the order you will most likely encounter them.

                     <h3 id="BasicsBucket">Buckets</h3>
                     			
                     			
                     <p> A bucket is a container for objects stored in Amazon S3. Every object is
                        				contained in a bucket. For example, if the object named
                        					<code class="code">photos/puppy.jpg</code> is stored in the <code class="code">johnsmith</code> bucket,
                        				then it is addressable using the URL
                        					<code class="code">http://johnsmith.s3.amazonaws.com/photos/puppy.jpg</code>
                        			
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p> Buckets serve several purposes: they organize the Amazon S3 namespace at the
                        				highest level, they identify the account responsible for storage and data transfer
                        				charges, they play a role in access control, and they serve as the unit of
                        				aggregation for usage reporting. 
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>You can configure buckets so that they are created in a specific region. For more
                        				information, see <a href="UsingBucket.html#access-bucket-intro">Buckets and Regions</a>. You
                        				can also configure a bucket so that every time an object is added to it, Amazon
                        S3
                        				generates a unique version ID and assigns it to the object. For more information,
                        				see <a href="Versioning.html">Versioning</a>.
                     </p>

                     <p>Objects are the fundamental entities stored in Amazon S3. Objects consist of
                        				object data and metadata. The data portion is opaque to Amazon S3. The metadata
                        is a
                        				set of name-value pairs that describe the object. These include some default
                        				metadata, such as the date last modified, and standard HTTP metadata, such as
                        				Content-Type. You can also specify custom metadata at the time the object
                        				is stored.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>An object is uniquely identified within a bucket by a key (name) and a version ID.
                        				For more information, see <a href="Introduction.html#BasicsKeys">Keys</a> and <a href="Versioning.html">Versioning</a>.
                     </p>
                     		
                     		
                     <h3 id="BasicsKeys">Keys</h3>
                     			
                     			
                     <p>A key is the unique identifier for an object within a bucket. Every object in a
                        				bucket has exactly one key. Because the combination of a bucket, key, and version
                        ID
                        				uniquely identify each object, Amazon S3 can be thought of as a basic data map
                        				between &quot;bucket + key + version&quot; and the object itself. Every object in Amazon
                        S3
                        				can be uniquely addressed through the combination of the web service endpoint,
                        				bucket name, key, and optionally, a version. For example, in the URL http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl,
                        				&quot;doc&quot; is the name of the bucket and &quot;2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl&quot; is the key.

                        				regulatory requirements. Objects stored in a region never leave the region unless
                        you explicitly transfer

                     <p>Amazon S3 provides read-after-write consistency for PUTS of new objects in your S3
                        bucket in all
                        				regions with one caveat. The caveat is that if you make a HEAD or GET request
                        to the
                        				key name (to find if the object exists) before creating the object, Amazon S3
                        				provides eventual consistency for read-after-write. 
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>Amazon S3 offers eventual consistency for overwrite PUTS and DELETES in all regions.

                     <p> Updates to a single key are atomic. For example, if you PUT to an existing key, a
                        				subsequent read might return the old data or the updated data, but it will never
                        				write corrupted or partial data.

                     <p>Amazon S3 achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers
                        				within Amazon&apos;s data centers. If a PUT request is successful, your data is safely
                        				stored. However, information about the changes must replicate
                        				across Amazon S3, which can take some time, and so you might observe the following
                        behaviors:

                        <p>Amazon S3 does not currently support object locking. If two PUT requests are
                           					simultaneously made to the same key, the request with the latest time stamp wins.
                           If

                     <p>Bucket policies provide centralized access control to buckets and objects based
                        				on a variety of conditions, including Amazon S3 operations, requesters, resources,
                        				and aspects of the request (e.g., IP address). The policies are expressed in our
                        					<em>access policy language</em> and enable centralized
                        				management of permissions. The permissions attached to a bucket apply to all of
                        the
                        				objects in that bucket. 
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>Individuals as well as companies can use bucket policies. When companies register
                        				with Amazon S3 they create an <em>account</em>.
                        				Thereafter, the company becomes synonymous with the account. Accounts are
                        				financially responsible for the Amazon resources they (and their employees) create.
                        				Accounts have the power to grant bucket policy permissions and assign employees
                        				permissions based on a variety of conditions. For example, an account could create
                        a
                        				policy that gives a user write access:

                     <p>An account can grant one user limited read and write access, but allow another to
                        create
                        				and delete buckets as well. An account could allow several field offices to store
                        				their daily reports in a single bucket, allowing each office to write only to
                        a
                        				certain set of names (e.g., &quot;Nevada/*&quot; or &quot;Utah/*&quot;) and only from the office&apos;s
                        IP
                        				address range.

                     <p>Unlike access control lists (described below), which can add (grant) permissions only
                        on individual
                        				objects, policies can either add or deny permissions across all (or a subset)
                        of
                        				objects within a bucket. With one request an account can set the permissions of
                        any
                        				number of objects in a bucket. An account can use wildcards (similar to regular
                        				expression operators) on Amazon resource names (ARNs) and other values, so that
                        an
                        				account can control access to groups of objects that begin with a common prefix
                        or
                        				end with a given extension such as .<em>html</em>.

                     <p>Only the bucket owner is allowed to associate a policy with a bucket. Policies,
                        				written in the access policy language, <em>allow</em> or

                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Amazon S3 provides a REST and a SOAP interface. They are similar, but there are some
                        			differences. For example, in the REST interface, metadata is returned in HTTP headers.
                        			Because we only support HTTP requests of up to 4 KB (not including the body), the
                        amount
                        			of metadata you can supply is restricted. 
                     </p>

                        <p>
                           SOAP support over HTTP is deprecated, but it is still available over HTTPS. 
                           New Amazon S3 features will not be supported for SOAP. We recommend that you use 
                           either the REST API or the AWS SDKs.

                     <p>The REST API is an HTTP interface to Amazon S3. Using REST, you use standard HTTP
                        				requests to create, fetch, and delete buckets and objects.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>You can use any toolkit that supports HTTP to use the REST API. You can even use a
                        				browser to fetch objects, as long as they are anonymously readable.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>The REST API uses the standard HTTP headers and status codes, so that standard
                        				browsers and toolkits work as expected. In some areas, we have added functionality
                        				to HTTP (for example, we added headers to support access control). In these cases,
                        				we have done our best to add the new functionality in a way that matched the style
                        				of standard HTTP usage.
                     </p>

                     <p>The SOAP API provides a SOAP 1.1 interface using document literal encoding. The
                        				most common way to use SOAP is to download the WSDL (go to <a href="http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl" target="_blank">http://doc.s3.amazonaws.com/2006-03-01/AmazonS3.wsdl</a>), use a SOAP toolkit such as Apache Axis or Microsoft .NET to
                        				create bindings, and then write code that uses the bindings to call Amazon
                        				S3.

                     <p>Pricing for Amazon S3 is designed so that you don&apos;t have to plan for the storage
                        			requirements of your application. Most storage providers force you to purchase
                        a
                        			predetermined amount of storage and network transfer capacity: If you exceed that
                        			capacity, your service is shut off or you are charged high overage fees. If you
                        do not
                        			exceed that capacity, you pay as though you used it all. 
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Amazon S3 charges you only for what you actually use, with no hidden fees and no
                        			overage charges. This gives developers a variable-cost service that can grow with
                        their
                        			business while enjoying the cost advantages of Amazon&apos;s infrastructure.

                     <p>Before storing anything in Amazon S3, you need to register with the service and
                        			provide a payment instrument that will be charged at the end of each month. There
                        are no
                        			set-up fees to begin using the service. At the end of the month, your payment instrument
                        			is automatically charged for that month&apos;s usage.
