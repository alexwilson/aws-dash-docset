                     <p>In general, you can use either a user policy or a bucket policy to manage permissions.
                        You
                        					may choose to manage permissions by creating users and managing permissions
                        					individually by attaching policies to users (or user groups), or you may find
                        					that resource-based policies, such as a bucket policy, work better for your
                        					scenario.
                     </p>
                     				
                     <p>Note that AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) enables you to create multiple
                        users within your AWS
                        					account and manage their permissions via user policies. An IAM user must have
                        					permissions from the parent account to which it belongs, and from the AWS
                        					account that owns the resource the user wants to access. The permissions can
                        be
                        					granted as follows:

                        In this

                     <p>If an AWS account owns a resource, it can grant those permissions to another AWS account.
                        						That account can then delegate those permissions, or a subset of them, to
                        						users in the account. This is referred to as permission delegation. But an
                        						account that receives permissions from another account cannot delegate
                        						permission cross-account to another AWS account.
