                     <p>To track requests for access to your bucket, you can enable access logging. Each access
                        log record provides details about a single access request, such as the requester,
                        bucket name,
                        request time, request action, response status, and error code, if any. Access log
                        information
                        can be useful in security and access audits. It can also help you learn about your
                        customer
                        base and understand your Amazon S3 bill. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <div class="aws-note">
                        <p class="aws-note">Note</p>
                        <p>There is no extra charge for enabling server access logging on an Amazon S3 bucket;
                           however,
                           any log files that the system delivers to you accrue the usual charges for storage.
                           (You can
                           delete the log files at any time.) No data transfer charges are assessed for log file
                           delivery, but access to the delivered log files is charged the same as any other data
                           transfer. 
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     
                     
                     <p> By default, logging is disabled. When logging is enabled, logs are saved to a bucket
                        in
                        the same AWS Region as the source bucket. To enable access logging, you must do the
                        following: 
                     </p>

                              <p> Turn on the log delivery by adding logging configuration on the bucket for which

                                 the
                                 access logs saved. We refer to this bucket as the <em>target bucket</em>.

                              <p> Name of the target bucket where you want Amazon S3 to save the access logs as objects.
                                 You
                                 can have logs delivered to any bucket that you own, including the source bucket. We
                                 recommend that you save access logs in a different bucket so you can easily manage
                                 the
                                 logs. If you choose to save access logs in the same bucket as the source bucket, we
                                 recommend that you specify a prefix to all log object keys so that you can easily
                                 identify
                                 the log objects. 
                              </p>
                              
                              
                              <p>Your logging source bucket and the destination bucket where your logs are written
                                 can
                                 be the same bucket. However, this requires the creation of additional logs for the
                                 logs
                                 that are written to the bucket. This behavior might not be ideal for your use case
                                 because
                                 it could result in a small increase in your storage billing, and the extra logs about
                                 logs
                                 might make it harder to find the correct log.

                              <p> (Optional) A prefix for Amazon S3 to assign to all log object keys. The prefix makes
                                 it
                                 simpler for you to locate the log objects. 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p> For example, if you specify the prefix value <code class="code">logs/</code>, each log object that
                                 Amazon S3 creates begins with the <code class="code">logs/</code> prefix in its key, as in this
                                 example:
                              </p>

                              <p> The key prefix can help when you delete the logs. For example, you can set a
                                 lifecycle configuration rule for Amazon S3 to delete objects with a specific key prefix.

                     <p>Amazon S3 uses the following object key format for the log objects it uploads in the

                        <code class="code">MM</code>, and <code class="code">SS</code> are the digits of the year, month, day, hour, minute,
                        and seconds (respectively) when the log file was delivered. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A log file delivered at a specific time can contain records written at any point before
                        that time. There is no way to know whether all log records for a certain time interval
                        have
                        been delivered or not.

                     <p> The <code class="code">UniqueString</code> component of the key is there to prevent overwriting of

                     <p>Amazon S3 periodically collects access log records, consolidates the records in log
                        files,
                        and then uploads log files to your target bucket as log objects. If you enable logging
                        on
                        multiple source buckets that identify the same target bucket, the target bucket will
                        have
                        access logs for all those source buckets. However, each log object reports access
                        log
                        records for a specific source bucket. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Amazon S3 uses a special log delivery account, called the Log Delivery group, to write
                        access
                        logs. These writes are subject to the usual access control restrictions. You must
                        grant the
                        Log Delivery group write permission on the target bucket by adding a grant entry in
                        the
                        bucket&apos;s access control list (ACL). If you use the Amazon S3 console to enable logging
                        on a
                        bucket, the console both enables logging on the source bucket and updates the ACL
                        on the
                        target bucket to grant write permission to the Log Delivery group.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <h3 id="LogDeliveryBestEffort">Best Effort Server Log Delivery</h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> Server access log records are delivered on a best effort basis. Most requests for
                        a
                        bucket that is properly configured for logging result in a delivered log record, and
                        most
                        log records are delivered within a few hours of the time that they are recorded. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>However, the completeness and timeliness of server logging is not guaranteed. The
                        log
                        record for a particular request might be delivered long after the request was actually
                        processed, or it might not be delivered at all. The purpose of server logs is to give
                        you an
                        idea of the nature of traffic against your bucket. It is rare to lose log records,
                        but
                        server logging is not meant to be a complete accounting of all requests. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>It follows from the best-effort nature of the server logging feature that the usage
                        reports available at the AWS portal (Billing and Cost Management reports on the <a href="https://console.aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS Management Console</a>) might include one or more access requests
                        that do not appear in a delivered server log. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <h3 id="BucketLoggingStatusChanges">Bucket Logging Status Changes Take Effect Over
                        Time
                     </h3>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p> Changes to the logging status of a bucket take time to actually affect the delivery
                        of
                        log files. For example, if you enable logging for a bucket, some requests made in
                        the
                        following hour might be logged, while others might not. If you change the target bucket
                        for
                        logging from bucket A to bucket B, some logs for the next hour might continue to be
                        delivered to bucket A, while others might be delivered to the new target bucket B.
                        In all
                        cases, the new settings eventually take effect without any further action on your
                        part.
