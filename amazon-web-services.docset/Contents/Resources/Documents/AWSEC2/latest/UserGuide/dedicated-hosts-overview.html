                     <p>Dedicated Hosts are configured to support a single instance type and size
                        capacity. The number of instances you can launch onto a Dedicated Host depends on
                        the
                        instance type that the Dedicated Host is configured to support. For example, if you
                        allocated a <code class="code">c3.xlarge</code> Dedicated Host, you&apos;d have the right to launch up to
                        eight <code class="code">c3.xlarge</code> instances on the Dedicated Host. To determine the number of
                        instance type sizes that you can run on a particular Dedicated Host, see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/dedicated-hosts/pricing/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 Dedicated Hosts
