                     <p>An Amazon EBS volume is a durable, block-level storage device that you can attach
                        to a single EC2
                        instance. You can use EBS volumes as primary storage for data that requires frequent
                        updates,
                        such as the system drive for an instance or storage for a database application. You
                        can also use
                        them for throughput-intensive applications that perform continuous disk scans. EBS
                        volumes
                        persist independently from the running life of an EC2 instance. After a volume is
                        attached to an
                        instance, you can use it like any other physical hard drive. EBS volumes are flexible.
                        For
                        current-generation volumes attached to current-generation instance types, you can
                        dynamically
                        increase size, modify provisioned IOPS capacity, and change volume type on live production
                        volumes. Amazon EBS provides the following volume types: General Purpose SSD (<code class="code">gp2</code>), Provisioned IOPS SSD (<code class="code">io1</code>), Throughput Optimized HDD
                        (<code class="code">st1</code>), Cold HDD (<code class="code">sc1</code>), and Magnetic (<code class="code">standard</code>, a previous-generation type). They differ in
                        performance characteristics and price, allowing you to tailor your storage performance
                        and cost
                        to the needs of your applications. For more information, see <a href="EBSVolumeTypes.html">Amazon EBS Volume Types</a>.

                              <p>When you create an EBS volume in an Availability Zone, it is automatically replicated
                                 within that zone to prevent data loss due to failure of any single hardware component.
                                 After you create a volume, you can attach it to any EC2 instance in the same Availability
                                 Zone. After you attach a volume, it appears as a native block device similar to a
                                 hard
                                 drive or other physical device. At that point, the instance can interact with the
                                 volume
                                 just as it would with a local drive. The instance can format the EBS volume with a
                                 file
                                 system, such as <span>ext3</span>, and
                                 then install applications.

                              <p>An EBS volume can be attached to only one instance at a time within the same
                                 Availability Zone. However, multiple volumes can be attached to a single instance.
                                 If you
                                 attach multiple volumes to a device that you have named, you can stripe data across
                                 the
                                 volumes for increased I/O and throughput performance.

                              <p>An EBS volume is off-instance storage that can persist independently from the life
                                 of
                                 an instance. You continue to pay for the volume usage as long as the data persists.
                                 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>By default, EBS volumes that are attached to a running instance automatically detach
                                 from the instance with their data intact when that instance is terminated. The volume
                                 can
                                 then be reattached to a new instance, enabling quick recovery. If you are using an
                                 EBS-backed instance, you can stop and restart that instance without affecting the
                                 data
                                 stored in the attached volume. The volume remains attached throughout the stop-start
                                 cycle. This enables you to process and store the data on your volume indefinitely,
                                 only
                                 using the processing and storage resources when required. The data persists on the
                                 volume
                                 until the volume is deleted explicitly. The physical block storage used by deleted

                                 volumes is overwritten with zeroes before it is allocated to another account. If you
                                 are
                                 dealing with sensitive data, you should consider encrypting your data manually or
                                 storing
                                 the data on a volume protected by Amazon EBS encryption. For more information, see

                              <p>By default, EBS volumes that are created and attached to an instance at launch are
                                 deleted when that instance is terminated. You can modify this behavior by changing
                                 the
                                 value of the flag <code class="code">DeleteOnTermination</code> to <code class="code">false</code> when you launch
                                 the instance. This modified value causes the volume to persist even after the instance
                                 is
                                 terminated, and enables you to attach the volume to another instance.

                              <p>For simplified data encryption, you can create encrypted EBS volumes with the
                                 Amazon EBS encryption feature. All EBS volume types support encryption. You can use
                                 encrypted EBS
                                 volumes to meet a wide range of data-at-rest encryption requirements for regulated/audited
                                 data and applications. Amazon EBS encryption uses 256-bit Advanced Encryption Standard
                                 algorithms
                                 (AES-256) and an Amazon-managed key infrastructure. The encryption occurs on the server
                                 that hosts the EC2 instance, providing encryption of data-in-transit from the EC2
                                 instance
                                 to Amazon EBS storage. For more information, see <a href="EBSEncryption.html">Amazon EBS Encryption</a>.

                              <p> Amazon EBS encryption uses AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) master keys when
                                 creating encrypted volumes and
                                 any snapshots created from your encrypted volumes. The first time you create an encrypted
                                 EBS volume in a region, a default master key is created for you automatically. This
                                 key is
                                 used for Amazon EBS encryption unless you select a customer master key (CMK) that
                                 you created
                                 separately using AWS KMS. Creating your own CMK gives you more flexibility, including
                                 the
                                 ability to create, rotate, disable, define access controls, and audit the encryption

                                 Availability Zones. The volume does not need be attached to a running instance in
                                 order to
                                 take a snapshot. As you continue to write data to a volume, you can periodically create
                                 a
                                 snapshot of the volume to use as a baseline for new volumes. These snapshots can be
                                 used
                                 to create multiple new EBS volumes or move volumes across
                                 Availability Zones. Snapshots of encrypted EBS volumes are automatically encrypted.
                                 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>When you create a new volume from a snapshot, it&apos;s an exact copy of the original
                                 volume at the time the snapshot was taken. EBS volumes that are restored from encrypted
                                 snapshots are automatically encrypted. By optionally specifying a different Availability
                                 Zone, you can use this functionality to create a duplicate volume in that zone. The
                                 snapshots can be shared with specific AWS accounts or made public. When you create
                                 snapshots, you incur charges in Amazon S3 based on the volume&apos;s total size. For a
                                 successive
                                 snapshot of the volume, you are only charged for any additional data beyond the volume&apos;s
                                 original size. 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>Snapshots are incremental backups, meaning that only the blocks on the volume that
                                 have changed after your most recent snapshot are saved. If you have a volume with
                                 100 GiB
                                 of data, but only 5 GiB of data have changed since your last snapshot, only the 5
                                 GiB of
                                 modified data is written to Amazon S3. Even though snapshots are saved incrementally,
                                 the
                                 snapshot deletion process is designed so that you need to retain only the most recent
                                 snapshot in order to restore the volume. 
                              </p>
                              
                              <p>To help categorize and manage your volumes and snapshots, you can tag them with
                                 metadata of your choice. For more information, see <a href="Using_Tags.html">Tagging Your Amazon EC2 Resources</a>.
