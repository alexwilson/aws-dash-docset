                     <p>On a given volume configuration, certain I/O characteristics drive the performance
                        behavior for your EBS volumes. SSD-backed volumes&#x2014;General Purpose SSD (<code class="code">gp2</code>) and Provisioned IOPS SSD (<code class="code">io1</code>)&#x2014;deliver
                        consistent performance whether an I/O operation is random or sequential. HDD-backed
                        volumes&#x2014;Throughput Optimized HDD (<code class="code">st1</code>) and Cold HDD (<code class="code">sc1</code>)&#x2014;deliver optimal performance only when I/O
                        operations are large and sequential. To understand how SSD and HDD volumes will perform
                        in
                        your application, it is important to know the connection between demand on the volume,
                        the
                        quantity of IOPS available to it, the time it takes for an I/O operation to complete,
                        and the
                        volume&apos;s throughput limits. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="title"><b>IOPS</b></p>
                     
                     <p>IOPS are a unit of measure representing input/output operations per second. The
                        operations are measured in KiB, and the underlying drive technology determines the
                        maximum
                        amount of data that a volume type counts as a single I/O. I/O size is capped at 256
                        KiB for
                        SSD volumes and 1,024 KiB for HDD volumes because SSD volumes handle small or random
                        I/O
                        much more efficiently than HDD volumes. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When small I/O operations are physically contiguous, Amazon EBS attempts to merge
                        them
                        into a single I/O up to the maximum size. For example, for SSD volumes, a single 1,024
                        KiB I/O
                        operation counts as 4 operations (1,024&#xF7;256=4), while 8 contiguous I/O operations
                        at 32 KiB
                        each count as 1operation (8&#xD7;32=256). However, 8 random I/O operations at 32 KiB each
                        count as
                        8 operations. Each I/O operation under 32 KiB counts as 1 operation.
                     </p>
                     <p>Similarly, for HDD-backed volumes, both a single 1,024 KiB I/O operation and 8 sequential
                        128 KiB operations would count as one operation. However, 8 random 128 KiB I/O operations
                        would count as 8 operations.
                     </p>
                     <p>Consequently, when you create an SSD-backed volume supporting 3,000 IOPS (either by
                        provisioning an <code class="code">io1</code> volume at 3,000 IOPS or by sizing a <code class="code">gp2</code> volume at 1000 GiB), and you
                        attach it to an EBS-optimized instance that can provide sufficient bandwidth, you
                        can transfer
                        up to 3,000 I/Os of data per second, with throughput determined by I/O size. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="title"><b>Volume Queue Length and Latency</b></p>
                     
                     <p>The volume queue length is the number of pending I/O requests for a device. Latency
                        is the
                        true end-to-end client time of an I/O operation, in other words, the time elapsed
                        between
                        sending an I/O to EBS and receiving an acknowledgement from EBS that the I/O read
                        or write
                        is complete. Queue length must be correctly calibrated with I/O size and latency to
                        avoid
                        creating bottlenecks either on the guest operating system or on the network link to
                        EBS.
                     </p>  
                     
                     <p>Optimal queue length varies for each workload, depending on your particular application&apos;s
                        sensitivity to IOPS and latency. If your workload is not delivering enough I/O requests
                        to
                        fully use the performance available to your EBS volume, then your volume might not
                        deliver the
                        IOPS or throughput that you have provisioned. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Transaction-intensive applications are sensitive to increased I/O latency and are
                        well-suited for SSD-backed <code class="code">io1</code> and <code class="code">gp2</code> volumes. You can maintain high IOPS while keeping
                        latency down by maintaining a low queue length and a high number of IOPS available
                        to the
                        volume. Consistently driving more IOPS to a volume than it has available can cause
                        increased
                        I/O latency. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Throughput-intensive applications are less sensitive to increased I/O latency, and
                        are
                        well-suited for HDD-backed <code class="code">st1</code> and <code class="code">sc1</code> volumes. You can maintain high throughput to
                        HDD-backed volumes by maintaining a high queue length when performing large, sequential
                        I/O.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p class="title"><b>I/O size and volume throughput limits</b></p>
                     
                     <p>For SSD-backed volumes, if your I/O size is very large, you may experience a smaller
                        number of IOPS than you provisioned because you are hitting the throughput limit of
                        the
                        volume. For example, a <code class="code">gp2</code> volume under 1000 GiB with burst credits available has an IOPS
                        limit of 3,000 and a volume throughput limit of 160 MiB/s. If you are using a 256
                        KiB I/O
                        size, your volume reaches its throughput limit at 640 IOPS (640 x 256 KiB = 160 MiB).
                        For
                        smaller I/O sizes (such as 16 KiB), this same volume can sustain 3,000 IOPS because
                        the
                        throughput is well below 160 MiB/s. (These examples assume that your volume&apos;s I/O
                        is not
                        hitting the throughput limits of the instance.) For more information about the throughput
                        limits for each EBS volume type, see <a href="EBSVolumeTypes.html">Amazon EBS Volume Types</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For smaller I/O operations, you may see a higher-than-provisioned IOPS value as measured
                        from inside your instance. This happens when the instance operating system merges
                        small I/O
                        operations into a larger operation before passing them to Amazon EBS.
                     </p>
                     <p>If your workload uses sequential I/Os on HDD-backed <code class="code">st1</code> and <code class="code">sc1</code> volumes, you may
                        experience a higher than expected number of IOPS as measured from inside your instance.
                        This
                        happens when the instance operating system merges sequential I/Os and counts them
                        in 1,024
                        KiB-sized units. If your workload uses small or random I/Os, you may experience a
                        lower
                        throughput than you expect. This is because we count each random, non-sequential I/O
                        toward
                        the total IOPS count, which can cause you to hit the volume&apos;s IOPS limit sooner than
                        expected.
                     </p>
                     <p>Whatever your EBS volume type, if you are not experiencing the IOPS or throughput
                        you
                        expect in your configuration, ensure that your EC2 instance bandwidth is not the limiting
                        factor. You should always use a current-generation, EBS-optimized instance (or one
                        that
                        includes 10 Gb/s network connectivity) for optimal performance. For more information,

                        <a href="ebs-ec2-config.html">Amazon EC2 Instance Configuration</a>. Another possible cause for
                        not experiencing the expected IOPS is that you are not driving enough I/O to the EBS
                        volumes.

                        <p>If average I/O size is at or near 44 KiB, you may be using an instance or kernel without
                           support for indirect descriptors. Any Linux kernel 3.8 and above has this support,
                           as well
                           as any current-generation instance. 
                        </p>
                     </div>
                     <p>If your I/O latency is higher than you require, check <code class="code">VolumeQueueLength</code> to
                        make sure your application is not trying to drive more IOPS than you have provisioned.
                        If your
                        application requires a greater number of IOPS than your volume can provide, you should
                        consider using a larger <code class="code">gp2</code> volume with a higher base performance level or an <code class="code">io1</code> volume
                        with more provisioned IOPS to achieve faster latencies.
                     </p>
