                     <p>By working with Amazon EC2 to manage your instances from the moment you launch them
                        through their termination, 
                        		you ensure that your customers have the best possible experience with the applications
                        or sites that you 
                        		host on your instances.
                     </p>
                     <p>The following illustration represents the transitions between instance states. Notice
                        that 
                        	    you can&apos;t stop and start an instance store-backed instance. For more information

                     <p>When you launch an instance, it enters the <code class="code">pending</code> state. 			
                        		    The instance type that you specified at launch determines the hardware of the
                        host computer for your instance.
                        		    We use the Amazon Machine Image (AMI) you specified at launch to boot the instance.
                        		    After the instance is ready for you, it enters the <code class="code">running</code> state.
                        		    You can connect to your running instance and use it the way that you&apos;d use a
                        computer sitting in front of you.

                     <p>As soon as your instance transitions to the <code class="code">running</code> state, you&apos;re billed for

                     <p>If your instance fails a status check or is not running your applications as expected,
                        
                        			and if the root volume of your instance is an Amazon EBS volume, you can stop and

                        			to try to fix the problem.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>When you stop your instance, it enters the <code class="code">stopping</code> state, and then the <code class="code">stopped</code> state.
                        			We don&apos;t charge  usage or data transfer fees for your instance after you stop it,
                        but we do charge for the storage for any Amazon EBS volumes. 			
                        			While your instance is in the <code class="code">stopped</code> state, you can modify certain attributes of the instance,
                        			including the instance type.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>When you start your instance, it enters the <code class="code">pending</code> state, and in most cases,
                        			we move the instance to a new host computer. (Your instance may stay on the same
                        host
                        			computer if there are no problems with the host computer.) When you stop and start
                        your
                        			instance, you lose any data on the instance store volumes on the previous host
                        			computer.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>If your instance is running in EC2-Classic, it receives a new private IPv4 address,
                        which
                        			means that an Elastic IP address associated with the private IPv4 address is no
                        longer
                        			associated with your instance. If your instance is running in EC2-VPC, it retains
                        its
                        			private IPv4 address, which means that an Elastic IP address associated with the
                        private
                        			IPv4 address or network interface is still associated with your instance. If your
                        			instance has an IPv6 address, it retains its IPv6 address.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Each time you transition an instance from <code class="code">stopped</code> to <code class="code">running</code>, we
                        			charge <span>per second when the
                           				instance is running, with a minimum of one minute every time you restart your
                           				instance.</span></p>

                     <p>You can reboot your instance using the Amazon EC2 console, a command line tool, and
                        the Amazon EC2
                        			API. We recommend that you use Amazon EC2 to reboot your instance instead of running
                        the
                        			operating system reboot command from your instance.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Rebooting an instance is equivalent to rebooting an operating system; the instance
                        			remains on the same host computer and maintains its public DNS name, private IP
                        address,
                        			and any data on its instance store volumes. It typically takes a few minutes for
                        the
                        			reboot to complete, but the time it takes to reboot depends on the instance
                        			configuration.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Rebooting an instance doesn&apos;t start a new instance billing <span>period; per second billing continues without a
                           				further one-minute minimum charge</span>.

                     <p>An instance is scheduled to be retired when AWS detects irreparable failure of the
                        			underlying hardware hosting the instance. When an instance reaches its scheduled
                        			retirement date, it is stopped or terminated by AWS. If your instance root device
                        is
                        			an Amazon EBS volume, the instance is stopped, and you can start it again at any
                        time. If
                        			your instance root device is an instance store volume, the instance is terminated,
                        and
                        			cannot be used again.

                     <p>If you enable termination protection, you can&apos;t terminate the instance using the console,

                     <p>Each Amazon EBS-backed instance supports the <code class="code">InstanceInitiatedShutdownBehavior</code>
                        			attribute, which controls whether the instance stops or terminates when you initiate

                           					<b>shutdown</b> command on Linux)</span>. The default behavior is
