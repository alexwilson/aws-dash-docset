                     <p>An <em>Amazon Machine Image (AMI)</em> is a template that contains a software
                        			configuration (for example, an operating system, an application server, and applications).
                        From an AMI,
                        			you launch an <em>instance</em>, which is a copy of the AMI running as a virtual server
                        			in the cloud. You can launch multiple instances of an AMI, as shown in the following
                        figure.
                     </p>
                     <div class="mediaobject">

                     <p>Your instances keep running until you stop or terminate them, or until they fail.
                        			If an instance fails, you can launch a new one from the AMI.
                     </p>

                     <p>You can launch different types of instances from a single AMI. An
                        				<em>instance type</em> essentially determines the hardware of the host computer
                        				used for your instance. Each instance type offers different compute and memory
                        capabilities. 
                        				Select an instance type based on the amount of memory and computing power that
                        you need for 
                        				the application or software	that you plan to run on the instance. 
                        				For more information about the hardware specifications for each Amazon EC2 instance
                        type,
                        see <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/instance-types/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2 Instance Types</a>.
                     </p>
                     			
                     			
                     <p>After you launch an instance, it looks like a traditional host, and you can interact
                        with it
                        				as you would any computer. You have complete control of your instances;
                        				you can use <b>sudo</b> to run commands that require root privileges.
                     </p>
                     
                     			
                     <p>Your AWS account has a limit on the number of instances that you can have running.
                        For more

                        which
                        				you can configure at launch time with block device mapping. For more information,
                        				see <a href="block-device-mapping-concepts.html">Block Device Mapping</a>. After these volumes have been
                        				added to and mapped on your instance, they are available for you to mount and
                        use.
                        				If your instance fails, or if your instance is stopped or terminated, the data
                        on
                        				these volumes is lost; therefore, these volumes are best used for temporary data.
                        				For important data, you should use a replication strategy across multiple instances
                        				in order to keep your data safe, or store your persistent data in Amazon S3 or

                     <p>Amazon Web Services (AWS) publishes many Amazon Machine Images (AMIs) that contain
                        common software configurations for public
                        				use. In addition, members of the AWS developer community have published their
                        own
                        				custom AMIs. You can also create your own custom AMI or AMIs; doing so enables
                        you to 
                        				quickly and easily start new instances that have everything you need. 
                        				For example, if your application is a website or a web service, your AMI could
                        include 
                        				a web server, the associated static content, and the code for the dynamic pages.
                        
                        				As a result, after you launch an instance from this AMI, your web server starts,
                        and 
                        				your application is ready to accept requests.
                     </p>
                     
                     			
                     <p>All AMIs are categorized as either <em>backed by Amazon EBS</em>, which means that
                        				the root device for an instance launched from the AMI is an Amazon EBS volume,
                        or
                        				<em>backed by instance store</em>, which means that the root device
                        				for an instance launched from the AMI is an instance store volume created from
                        a
                        				template stored in Amazon S3.
                     </p>
                     			
                     			
                     <p>The description of an AMI indicates the type of root device (either <code class="code">ebs</code> or <code class="code">instance store</code>).
                        				This is important because there are significant differences in what you can do
                        with each type of AMI.
                        				For more information about these differences, see <a href="ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device">Storage for the Root Device</a>.
