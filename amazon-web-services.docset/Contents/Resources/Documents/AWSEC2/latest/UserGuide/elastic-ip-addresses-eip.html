                     <p>An <em>Elastic IP address</em> is a static IPv4 address designed for dynamic
                        		cloud computing. An Elastic IP address is associated with your AWS account. With
                        an Elastic
                        		IP address, you can mask the failure of an instance or software by rapidly remapping
                        the
                        		address to another instance in your account. 
                     </p>
                     <p>An Elastic IP address is a public IPv4 address, which is reachable from the internet.
                        If
                        		your instance does not have a public IPv4 address, you can associate an Elastic
                        IP address
                        		with your instance to enable communication with the internet; for example, to connect
                        to
                        		your instance from your local computer.
                     </p>
                     <p>We currently do not support Elastic IP addresses for IPv6.</p>

                        you
                        migrate it again. You can only migrate an Elastic IP address from EC2-Classic to EC2-VPC.
                        You cannot migrate an Elastic IP address that was originally allocated for use in
                        EC2-VPC to
                        EC2-Classic. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To migrate an Elastic IP address, it must not be associated with an instance. For
                        more
                        information about disassociating an Elastic IP address from an instance, see <a href="elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html#using-instance-addressing-eips-associating-different">Disassociating an Elastic IP

                     <p>You can migrate as many EC2-Classic Elastic IP addresses as you can have in your account.
                        However, when you migrate an Elastic IP address to EC2-VPC, it counts against your
                        Elastic IP
                        address limit for EC2-VPC. You cannot migrate an Elastic IP address if it will result
                        in you
                        exceeding your limit. Similarly, when you restore an Elastic IP address to EC2-Classic,
                        it
                        counts against your Elastic IP address limit for EC2-Classic. For more information,

                        			will be flagged as spam.

                        			address to another instance in the case of instance failure, and to use DNS hostnames
                        			for all other inter-node communication.
