                     <p>As your needs change, you might find that your instance is over-utilized (the instance
                        type
                        is too small) or under-utilized (the instance type is too large). If this is the case,
                        you can
                        change the size of your instance. For example, if your <code class="code">t2.micro</code> instance is too
                        small for its workload, you can change it to an <code class="code">m3.medium</code> instance.
                     </p>
                     <p>If the root device for your instance is an EBS volume, you can change the size of
                        the
                        instance simply by changing its instance type, which is known as <em>resizing</em>
                        it. If the root device for your instance is an instance store volume, you must migrate
                        your
                        application to a new instance with the instance type that you need. For more information
                        about
                        root device volumes, see <a href="ComponentsAMIs.html#storage-for-the-root-device">Storage for the Root Device</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>When you resize an instance, you must select an instance type that is compatible with
                        the
                        configuration of the instance. If the instance type that you want is not compatible
                        with the
                        instance configuration you have, then you must migrate your application to a new instance
                        with
                        the instance type that you need.

                        <p>When you resize an instance, the resized instance usually has the same number of instance
                           store volumes that you specified when you launched the original instance. If you want
                           to add
                           instance store volumes, you must migrate your application to a  new instance with
                           the instance
                           type and instance store volumes that you need. An exception to this rule is when you
                           resize to
                           a storage-optimized instance type that by default contains a higher number of volumes.

                              <p>If your instance is in an Auto Scaling group, the Amazon EC2 Auto Scaling service
                                 marks the stopped
                                 instance as unhealthy, and may terminate it and launch a replacement instance.
                                 To prevent this, you can suspend the scaling processes for the group while
                                 you&apos;re resizing your instance. For more information, see <a href="./autoscaling/latest/userguide/as-suspend-resume-processes.html" target="_blank">Suspending and Resuming
