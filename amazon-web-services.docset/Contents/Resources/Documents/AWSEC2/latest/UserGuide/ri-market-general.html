                     <p>The Reserved Instance Marketplace is a platform that supports the sale of third-party
                        and AWS customers&apos;
                        			unused Standard Reserved Instances, which vary in term lengths and pricing options.
                        For
                        			example, you may want to sell Reserved Instances after moving instances to a new
                        AWS
                        			region, changing to a new instance type, ending projects before the term expiration,
                        			when your business needs change, or if you have unneeded capacity.
                     </p>
                     <p>If you want to sell your unused Reserved Instances on the Reserved Instance Marketplace,
                        you must meet
                        			certain eligibility criteria.

                     <p>As soon as you list your Reserved Instances in the Reserved Instance Marketplace,
                        they are available
                        				for potential buyers to find. All Reserved Instances are grouped according to
                        the
                        				duration of the term remaining and the hourly price.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>To fulfill a buyer&apos;s request, AWS first sells the Reserved Instance with the
                        				lowest upfront price in the specified grouping. Then, we sell the Reserved Instance
                        				with the next lowest price, until the buyer&apos;s entire order is fulfilled. AWS then
                        				processes the transactions and transfers ownership of the Reserved Instances to
                        the
                        				buyer. 
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>You own your Reserved Instance until it&apos;s sold. After the sale, you&apos;ve given up the
                        				capacity reservation and the discounted recurring fees. If you continue to use
                        your
                        				instance, AWS charges you the On-Demand price starting from the time that your
                        				Reserved Instance was sold.

                        						AWS can set prices to decrease in equal increments month over month.
                        						However, you can set different upfront prices based on when your reservation
                        						sells.
