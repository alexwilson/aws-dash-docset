                     <p>Reserved Instances provide you with a significant discount compared to On-Demand Instance
                        		pricing. Reserved Instances are not physical instances, but rather a billing discount
                        		applied to the use of On-Demand Instances in your account. These On-Demand Instances
                        must
                        		match certain attributes in order to benefit from the billing discount.
                     </p>
                     <p>The following diagram shows a basic overview of purchasing and using Reserved Instances.

                     <p>In this scenario, you have a running On-Demand Instance (T2) in your account, for
                        which
                        		you&apos;re currently paying On-Demand rates. You purchase a Reserved Instance that matches
                        the
                        		attributes of your running instance, and the billing benefit is immediately applied.
                        Next,
                        		you purchase a Reserved Instance for a C4 instance. You do not have any running
                        instances in
                        		your account that match the attributes of this Reserved Instance. In the final step,
                        you
                        		launch an instance that matches the attributes of the C4 Reserved Instance, and
                        the billing
                        		benefit is immediately applied.
                     </p>
                     <p>When you purchase a Reserved Instance, choose a combination of the following that

                     <p>You are limited to purchasing 20 Reserved Instances per Availability Zone, per month,
                        plus
                        			20 regional Reserved Instances. Therefore, in a region that has three Availability
                        			Zones, you can purchase 80 Reserved Instances in total: 20 per Availability Zone
                        (60)
                        			plus 20 regional Reserved Instances.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Reserved Instances that are purchased for a specific Availability Zone (zonal Reserved
                        Instances) allow you to launch
                        			as many instances that are covered by the zonal Reserved Instances, even if this
                        results in your
                        			exceeding your On-Demand Instance limit. For example, your running On-Demand Instance
                        limit is 20, and you are
                        			currently running 18 On-Demand Instances. You have five unused zonal Reserved Instances.
                        You can launch two more
                        			On-Demand Instances with any specifications, and you can launch five instances
                        that exactly match the
                        			specifications of your zonal Reserved Instances; giving you a total of 25 instances.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>Regional Reserved Instances do not increase your On-Demand Instance limit.</p>
