                     <p>T2 Unlimited is a configuration option for T2 instances that can be set at launch,
                        or
                        enabled at any time for a running or stopped T2 instance.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>T2 Unlimited instances can burst above the baseline for as long as required. This
                        enables you to enjoy the low T2 instance hourly price for a wide variety of
                        general-purpose applications, and ensures that your instances are never held to the
                        baseline performance. &#x200B;The basic T2 hourly instance price automatically covers all
                        CPU
                        usage spikes if the average CPU utilization of a T2 Unlimited instance over a rolling
                        24-hour period is at or below the baseline. For a vast majority of general-purpose
                        workloads, T2 Unlimited instances provide ample performance without any additional
                        charges. If the average CPU utilization exceeds the baseline over a 24-hour period,
                        there is a flat additional rate per vCPU-hour. For more information, see the T2
                        Unlimited Pricing section in <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/pricing/on-demand/" target="_blank">Amazon EC2

                     <p class="title"><b>How T2 Unlimited Works</b></p>
                     
                     <p>If a T2 Unlimited instance depletes its CPU credit balance, it can spend <em>surplus</em> credits to burst beyond the baseline. When its
                        CPU utilization falls below the baseline, it uses the CPU credits that it earns to
                        pay down the surplus credits it spent earlier. The ability to earn CPU credits to
                        pay
                        down surplus credits enables Amazon EC2 to average the CPU utilization of an instance
                        over
                        a 24-hour period. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p class="title"><b>Surplus Credits Can Incur Charges</b></p>
                     
                     <p>If the average CPU utilization of an instance is at or below the baseline, the
                        instance incurs no additional charges. Because an instance earns a <a href="t2-credits-baseline-concepts.html#t2-credit-table">maximum number of credits</a> in a 24-hour period
                        (for example, a <code class="code">t2.micro</code> can earn a maximum of 144 credits in a 24-hour
                        period), it can spend surplus credits up to that maximum without being
                        charged.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>However, if CPU utilization stays above the baseline, the instance cannot earn enough
                        credits to pay down the surplus credits it has spent. The surplus credits that are
                        not
                        paid down are charged at a flat additional rate per vCPU-hour. For more information,

                     <p>To see if your T2 Unlimited instance is spending more credits than the baseline
                        provides, you can use CloudWatch metrics to track and set up hourly alarms to be notified
                        of credit usage. For more information, see <a href="t2-instances-monitoring-cpu-credits.html">Monitoring Your CPU Credits</a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     
                     <h2 id="t2_unlimited_example">Example: Explaining Credit Use with T2
                        Unlimited
                     </h2>
                     
                     <p>In this example, you see the CPU utilization of a <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance
                        launched as Unlimited, and how it spends <em>earned</em> and
                        <em>surplus</em> credits to sustain CPU performance.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance earns 72 CPU credits over a rolling 24-hour period,
                        which it can redeem for 72 minutes of vCPU use. When it depletes its CPU credit balance
                        (represented by the CloudWatch metric <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code>), it can spend <em>surplus</em> CPU credits&#x2014;that it has <em>not yet earned</em>&#x2014;to burst for as long as it needs.
                        Because a <code class="code">t2.nano</code> earns a maximum of 72 credits in a 24-hour period, it can
                        spend surplus credits up to that maximum without being charged immediately. If it
                        spends
                        more than 72 CPU credits, it is charged for the difference at the end of the
                        hour.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>The intent of the example, illustrated by the following graph, is to show how an
                        instance can burst using surplus credits even after it depletes its
                        <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code>. You can assume that, at the start of the time line
                        in the graph, the instance has an accrued credit balance equal to the maximum number
                        of credits it can earn in 24 hours. The following workflow references the numbered
                        points on the graph: 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p><b>1</b> &#x2013; In the first 10 minutes,
                        <code class="code">CPUCreditUsage</code> is at 0, and the <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code> remains at
                        its maximum of 72.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><b>2</b> &#x2013; At 23:40, as CPU utilization increases,
                        the instance spends CPU credits and the <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code> decreases.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><b>3</b> &#x2013; At around 00:47, the instance depletes
                        its entire <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code>, and starts to spend surplus credits to sustain
                        high CPU performance.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><b>4</b> &#x2013; Surplus credits are spent until 01:55,
                        when the <code class="code">CPUSurplusCreditBalance</code> reaches 72 CPU credits. This is equal to
                        the maximum a <code class="code">t2.nano</code> can earn in a 24-hour period. Any surplus credits
                        spent thereafter cannot be offset by earned credits within the 24-hour period, which
                        results in a small additional charge at the end of the hour.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p><b>5</b> &#x2013; The instance continues to spend surplus
                        credits until around 02:20. At this time, CPU utilization falls below the baseline,
                        and
                        the instance starts to earn credits at 3 credits per hour (or 0.25 credits every 5
                        minutes), which it uses to pay down the <code class="code">CPUSurplusCreditBalance</code>. After the
                        <code class="code">CPUSurplusCreditBalance</code> reduces to 0, the instance starts to accrue
                        earned credits in its <code class="code">CPUCreditBalance</code> at 0.25 credits every 5
                        minutes.
