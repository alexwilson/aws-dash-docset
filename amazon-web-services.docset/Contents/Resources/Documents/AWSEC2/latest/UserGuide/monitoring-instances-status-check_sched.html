                     <p>AWS can schedule events for your instances, such as a reboot, stop/start, or retirement.
                        
                        These events do not occur frequently. If one of your instances will be affected by
                        a scheduled event, 
                        AWS sends an email to the email address that&apos;s associated with your AWS account
                        prior to the scheduled event, with details about the event, including the start and
                        end date.
                        Depending on the event, you might be able to take action to control the timing of
                        the event.
                     </p>
                     <p>To update the contact information for your account so that you can be sure to be notified
                        about

                        it schedules the instance to stop or terminate, depending on the type of root device
                        for the instance. If the root device is an EBS volume, the instance is scheduled to
                        stop.
                        If the root device is an instance store volume, the instance is scheduled to terminate.

                     <p>We recommend that you launch a replacement instance from your most recent AMI 
                        and migrate all necessary data to the replacement instance before the instance
                        is scheduled to terminate. Then, you can terminate the original instance, or wait

                     <p>When AWS needs to perform tasks such as installing updates or maintaining the
                        underlying host computer, it can schedule an instance or the underlying host
                        computer for the instance for a reboot. Regardless of any existing instances that
                        are scheduled for reboot, a new instance launch does not require a reboot, as the
                        updates are already applied on the underlying host.

                     <p>You can determine whether the reboot event is an instance reboot or a system

                     <p>You can wait for the instance reboot to occur within its scheduled maintenance
                        window. Alternatively, you can reboot your instance yourself at a time that is

                        after it has fully booted.

                     <p>It is not possible for you to reboot the system yourself. We recommend that
                        you wait for the system reboot to occur during its scheduled maintenance window.
                        A system reboot typically completes in a matter of minutes, the instance retains
                        its IP address and DNS name, and any data on local instance store volumes is
                        preserved. After the system reboot has occurred, the scheduled event for the 
                        instance is cleared, and you can verify that the software on your instance is 
                        operating as you expect.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <p>Alternatively, if it is necessary to maintain the instance at a different time, you
                        
                        can stop and start an EBS-backed instance, which migrates it to a new host. However,
                        
                        the data on the local instance store volumes would not be preserved. In the case of
                        an instance store-backed instance, you can launch a replacement instance from your
                        most recent AMI.

                        the instance for maintenance. There are two types of maintenance events: network

                     <p>During network maintenance, scheduled instances lose network connectivity for a brief
                        period of time. 
                        Normal network connectivity to your instance will be restored after maintenance is

                     <p>During power maintenance, scheduled instances are taken offline for a brief period,
