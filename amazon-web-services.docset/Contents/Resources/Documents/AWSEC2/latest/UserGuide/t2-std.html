                     <h3 id="w2ab1c17c11c23c19b9b3">How T2 Standard Works</h3>
                     
                     <p>A T2 Standard instance receives two types of CPU credits: <em>earned credits</em> and <em>launch credits</em>.
                        When a T2 Standard instance is in a running state, it continuously earns (at a
                        millisecond-level resolution) a set rate of earned credits per hour. At start, it
                        has
                        not yet earned credits for a good startup experience; therefore, to provide a good
                        startup experience, it receives launch credits at start, which it spends first while
                        it accrues earned credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When a T2 Standard instance is stopped, it loses all its accrued credits, and its
                        credit balance is reset to zero. When it is restarted, it receives a new set of launch
                        credits, and begins to accrue earned credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <h3 id="launch-credits">Launch Credits</h3>
                     
                     <p>T2 Standard instances get 30 launch credits per vCPU at launch or start. For
                        example, a <code class="code">t2.micro</code> has one vCPU and gets 30 launch credits, while a
                        <code class="code">t2.xlarge</code> has four vCPUs and gets 120 launch credits. Launch credits
                        are designed to provide a good startup experience to allow instances to burst
                        immediately after launch before they have accrued earned credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Launch credits are spent first, before earned credits. Unspent launch credits are
                        accrued in the CPU credit balance, but do not count towards the CPU credit balance
                        limit. For example, a <code class="code">t2.micro</code> instance has a CPU credit balance limit of
                        144 earned credits. If it is launched and remains idle for 24 hours, its CPU credit
                        balance reaches 174 (30 launch credits + 144 earned credits), which is over the limit.
                        However, once the instance spends the 30 launch credits, the credit balance cannot
                        exceed 144. For more information about the CPU credit balance limit for each T2 instance
                        size, see the <a href="t2-credits-baseline-concepts.html#t2-credit-table">T2 credit table</a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following table lists the initial CPU credit allocation received at launch or
                        start, and the number of vCPUs.

                     <p>There is a limit to the number of times T2 Standard instances can receive launch
                        credits. The default limit is 100 launches or starts of all T2 Standard instances
                        combined per account, per region, per rolling 24-hour period. For example, the limit
                        is reached when one instance is stopped and started 100 times within a 24-hour
                        period, or when 100 instances are launched within a 24-hour period, or other
                        combinations that equate to 100 starts. New accounts may have a lower limit, which
                        increases over time based on your usage.

                     <p>In this example, you see how a <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance launched as
                        <code class="code">standard</code> earns, accrues, and spends <em>launch</em> and <em>earned</em> credits. You see how
                        the credit balance reflects not only accrued <em>earned</em>
                        credits, but also accrued <em>launch</em> credits.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A <code class="code">t2.nano</code> instance gets 30 launch credits when it is launched, and earns
                        72 credits every 24 hours. Its credit balance limit is 72 earned credits; launch credits
                        do not count towards the limit. After the limit is reached, new credits that are earned
                        are discarded. For more information about the number of credits that can be earned
                        and
                        accrued, see the <a href="t2-credits-baseline-concepts.html#t2-credit-table">T2 credit table</a>. For more
                        information about launch credit limits, see <a href="t2-std.html#launch-credit-limits">Launch Credit Limits</a>.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>You might launch a T2 Standard instance and use it immediately, or you might launch
                        a
                        T2 Standard instance and leave it idle for a few days before running applications
                        on it.
                        Whether an instance is used or remains idle determines how many credits are accrued
                        and
                        spent. If an instance remains idle for 24 hours from the time it is launched, the
                        credit
                        balance appears to exceed its limit because the balance reflects both accrued earned
                        credits and accrued launch credits. However, after CPU is used, the launch credits
                        are
                        spent first. Thereafter, the limit always reflects the maximum number of earned credits
                        that can be accrued.

                     <p>This example describes an instance that remains idle for 24 hours from the time it
                        is
                        launched, and walks you through seven periods of time over a 96-hour period, showing
                        the
                        rate at which credits are earned, accrued, spent, and discarded, and the value of
                        the
                        credit balance at the end of each period.

                     <p>At Hour 0, the T2 instance is launched as <code class="code">standard</code> and immediately
                        gets 30 launch credits. It earns credits while in the running state. The instance
                        remains idle from the time it is launched&#x2014;CPU utilization is 0%&#x2014;and no
                        credits are spent. All unspent credits are accrued in the credit balance. At
                        approximately 14 hours after launch, the credit balance is 72 (30 launch credits +
                        42
                        earned credits), which is equivalent to what the instance can earn in 24 hours. At
                        24
                        hours after launch, the credit balance exceeds 72 credits because the unspent launch
                        credits are accrued in the credit balance&#x2014;the credit balance is 102 credits:
                        30 launch credits + 72 earned credits.

                        credits do not count towards the credit limit. After the launch credits are spent,
                        the balance can never go higher than what can be earned in 24 hours. Furthermore,
                        while an instance is running, it cannot get more launch credits.

                        the limit are discarded. The balance plateaus at 72 credits, which is different from
                        the plateau of 102 credits during Period 2, because there are no accrued launch
                        credits.

                     <p>For the next 14 hours, the instance uses 2% CPU, which requires 30 credits, the
                        same as in Periods 3 and 4. However, the balance increases in this period, whereas
                        it
                        decreased in Period 3 and plateaued in Period 4.

                     <p>In Period 3, the accrued launch credits were spent, and any earned credits that
                        exceeded the credit limit were discarded, resulting in a decrease in the credit
                        balance. In Period 4, the instance spent fewer credits than it earned, and any earned
                        credits that exceeded the limit were discarded, so the balance plateaued at its
                        maximum of 72 credits.

                        earned credits in the balance is below the limit. No earned credits are discarded.
                        Furthermore, the instance earns more credits than it spends, resulting in an increase
                        in the credit balance.
