                     <p>All Reserved Instances provide you with a discount compared to On-Demand pricing.
                        With
                        			Reserved Instances, you pay for the entire term regardless of actual use. You can
                        choose
                        			to pay for your Reserved Instance upfront, partially upfront, or monthly, depending
                        on
                        			the <a href="ec2-reserved-instances.html#ri-payment-options">payment option</a> specified for the Reserved Instance. 
                     </p>
                     <p>When Reserved Instances expire, you are charged On-Demand rates for EC2 instance
                        usage. You can set up a billing alert to warn you when your bill exceeds a threshold
                        you

                           					multiple instances concurrently, but can only receive the benefit of the

                        and add the

                        					value is based on undiscounted (public) pricing, it is not affected if you
                        					qualify for a volume discount or if the price drops after you buy your Reserved
                        Instances.
