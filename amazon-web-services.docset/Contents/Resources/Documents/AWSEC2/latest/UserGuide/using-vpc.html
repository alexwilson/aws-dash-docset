                     <p>Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (Amazon VPC) enables you to define a virtual network
                        in your own 
                        logically isolated area within the AWS cloud, known as a 
                        <em>virtual private cloud (VPC)</em>. You can launch your 
                        AWS resources, such as instances, into your VPC. Your VPC closely resembles a 
                        traditional network that you might operate in your own data center, with the 
                        benefits of using AWS&apos;s scalable infrastructure. You can configure your VPC; 
                        you can select its IP address range, create subnets, and configure route tables, 
                        network gateways, and security settings. You can connect instances in your VPC 
                        to the internet. You can connect your VPC to your own corporate data center, 
                        making the AWS cloud an extension of your data center. To protect the resources 
                        in each subnet, you can use multiple layers of security, including security groups
                        
                        and network access control lists. For more information, see the <a href="./AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/" target="_blank">Amazon VPC User Guide</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>Your account may support both the EC2-VPC and EC2-Classic platforms, on a region-by-region
                        basis. If you created your account after 2013-12-04, it supports EC2-VPC only. To
                        find out which
                        platforms your account supports, see <a href="ec2-supported-platforms.html">Supported Platforms</a>. If your accounts supports EC2-VPC only, we create a
                        <em>default VPC</em> for you. A default VPC is a VPC that is already configured
                        and ready for you to use. You can launch instances into your default VPC immediately.
                        For more
                        information, see <a href="./AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/default-vpc.html" target="_blank">Your Default VPC and
                           Subnets</a> in the <em>Amazon VPC User Guide</em>. If your account supports
                        EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC, you can launch instances into either platform. Regardless
                        of which
                        platforms your account supports, you can create your own <em>nondefault VPC</em>,
                        and configure it as you need.
