                     <p>We provide your instances with IP addresses and IPv4 DNS hostnames. These can vary
                        depending
                        		on whether you launched the instance in the EC2-Classic platform or in a virtual
                        private
                        		cloud (VPC). For information about the EC2-Classic and EC2-VPC platforms, see <a href="ec2-supported-platforms.html">Supported Platforms</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>Amazon EC2 and Amazon VPC support both the IPv4 and IPv6 addressing protocols. By
                        default, Amazon EC2 and
                        		Amazon VPC use the IPv4 addressing protocol; you can&apos;t disable this behavior. When
                        you create a
                        		VPC, you must specify an IPv4 CIDR block (a range of private IPv4 addresses). You
                        can
                        		optionally assign an IPv6 CIDR block to your VPC and subnets, and assign IPv6 addresses
                        from
                        		that block to instances in your subnet. IPv6 addresses are reachable over the Internet.
                        For
                        		more information about IPv6, see <a href="./AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/vpc-ip-addressing.html" target="_blank">IP Addressing

                     <p>A private IPv4 address is an IP address that&apos;s not reachable over the Internet. You
                        can use
                        private IPv4 addresses for communication between instances in the same network
                        (EC2-Classic or a VPC). For more information about the standards and specifications
                        of
                        private IPv4 addresses, see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1918.html" target="_blank">RFC
                           1918</a>. We allocate private IPv4 addresses to instances using DHCP.
                     </p>

                        <p>You can create a VPC with a publicly routable CIDR block that falls outside of the
                           private
                           				IPv4 address ranges specified in RFC 1918. However, for the purposes of this
                           				documentation, we refer to private IPv4 addresses (or &apos;private IP addresses&apos;)
                           as the
                           				IP addresses that are within the IPv4 CIDR range of your VPC.

                     <p>When you launch an instance, we allocate a primary private IPv4 address for the instance.
                        Each instance is also given an internal DNS hostname that resolves to the primary
                        private IPv4 address; for example, <code class="code">ip-10-251-50-12.ec2.internal</code>.
                        You can use the internal DNS hostname for communication between instances in the same
                        network, but we can&apos;t resolve the DNS hostname outside the network that the instance
                        is
                        in.

                     <p>An instance launched in a VPC receives a primary private IP address from the IPv4
                        address
                        range of the subnet. For more information, see <a href="./AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Subnets.html#SubnetSize" target="_blank">Subnet Sizing</a> in the
                        <em>Amazon VPC User Guide</em>. If you don&apos;t specify a primary private IP
                        address when you launch the instance, we select an available IP address in the subnet&apos;s
                        IPv4 range for you. Each instance in a VPC has a default network interface (eth0)
                        that
                        is assigned the primary private IPv4 address. You can also specify additional private
                        IPv4 addresses, known as <em>secondary private IPv4 addresses</em>. Unlike
                        primary private IP addresses, secondary private IP addresses can be reassigned from
                        one
                        instance to another. For more information, see <a href="MultipleIP.html">Multiple IP Addresses</a>.

                     <p>For instances launched in EC2-Classic, we release the private IPv4 address when the
                        			instance is stopped or terminated. If you restart your stopped instance, it receives
                        a
                        			new private IPv4 address.

                     <p>For instances launched in a VPC, a private IPv4 address remains associated with the
                        network
                        			interface when the instance is stopped and restarted, and is released when the
                        instance
                        			is terminated.
                     </p>
                     		
                     <p>If you create a custom firewall configuration in EC2-Classic, you must create a rule
                        in
                        			your firewall that allows inbound traffic from port 53 (DNS)&#x2014;with a destination
                        			port from the ephemeral range&#x2014;from the address of the Amazon DNS server;
                        			otherwise, internal DNS resolution from your instances fails. If your firewall
                        doesn&apos;t
                        			automatically allow DNS query responses, then you need to allow traffic from the
                        IP
                        			address of the Amazon DNS server. To get the IP address of the Amazon DNS server,
                        use
                        			the following command from within your instance:

                     <p>A public IP address is an IPv4 address that&apos;s reachable from the Internet. You can

                     <p>Each instance that receives a public IP address is also given an external DNS hostname;

                        			example, <code class="code">ec2-203-0-113-25.compute-1.amazonaws.com</code>. We resolve an external

                        of the
                        			instance. The public IP address is mapped to the primary private IP address through
                        			network address translation (NAT). For more information about NAT, see <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1631.html" target="_blank">RFC 1631: The IP Network Address

                     <p>When you launch an instance in EC2-Classic, we automatically assign a public IP address
                        to
                        			the instance from the EC2-Classic public IPv4 address pool. You cannot modify this
                        			behavior. When you launch an instance into a VPC, your subnet has an attribute

                        			instances launched in a default VPC, and we don&apos;t assign a public IP address to

                     <p>If you require a persistent public IP address that can be associated to and from instances
                        as you require, use an Elastic IP address instead. For example, if you use dynamic
                        DNS to map
                        an existing DNS name to a new instance&apos;s public IP address, it might take up to 24
                        hours for
                        the IP address to propagate through the Internet. As a result, new instances might
                        not receive
                        traffic while terminated instances continue to receive requests. To solve this problem,
                        use an
                        Elastic IP address. You can allocate your own Elastic IP address, and associate it
                        with your
                        instance. For more information, see <a href="elastic-ip-addresses-eip.html">Elastic IP Addresses</a>.

                     <p>If you launch an instance in EC2-Classic, it is assigned a public IPv4 address by
                        default.
                        				You can&apos;t modify this behavior.

                     <p>In a VPC, all subnets have an attribute that determines whether instances launched
                        into that
                        				subnet are assigned a public IP address. By default, nondefault subnets have this
                        				attribute set to false, and default subnets have this attribute set to true. When
                        				you launch an instance, a public IPv4 addressing feature is also available for
                        you
                        				to control whether your instance is assigned a public IPv4 address; you can override
                        				the default behavior of the subnet&apos;s IP addressing attribute. The public IPv4
                        				address is assigned from Amazon&apos;s pool of public IPv4 addresses, and is assigned
                        to
                        				the network interface with the device index of eth0. This feature depends on certain
                        				conditions at the time you launch your instance.
