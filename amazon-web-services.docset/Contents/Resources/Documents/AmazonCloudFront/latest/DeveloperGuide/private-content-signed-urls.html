                        			that gives you more control over access to your content. This additional information
                        appears
                        			in a policy statement, which is based on either a canned policy or a custom policy.

                     <p>You can distribute private content using a signed URL that is valid for only a short
                        				time&#x2014;possibly for as little as a few minutes. Signed URLs that are valid for such
                        a
                        				short period are good for distributing content on-the-fly to a user for a limited
                        purpose,
                        				such as distributing movie rentals or music downloads to customers on demand.
                        If your signed
                        				URLs will be valid for just a short period, you&apos;ll probably want to generate them
                        				automatically using an application that you develop. When the user starts to download
                        an
                        				object or starts to play a media file, CloudFront compares the expiration time
                        in the URL with the
                        				current time to determine whether the URL is still valid.

                     <p>You can also distribute private content using a signed URL that is valid for a longer
                        				time, possibly for years. Signed URLs that are valid for a longer period are useful
                        for
                        				distributing private content to known users, such as distributing a business plan
                        to
                        				investors or distributing training materials to employees. You can develop an
                        application to
                        				generate these longer-term signed URLs for you, or you can use one of the third-party
                        GUI
