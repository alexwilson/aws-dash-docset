                        				How RSA Ciphers Work

                     <p>CloudFront and origin servers typically use RSA 2048-bit asymmetric keys for SSL/TLS
                        termination. 
                        				RSA algorithms use the product of two large prime numbers, with another number
                        added to it to 
                        				create a public key. The private key is a related number. The strength of RSA
                        relies on the presumed 
                        				difficulty of breaking a key that requires factoring the product of two large
                        prime numbers. However, 
                        				improvements in computer technology have weakened RSA algorithms because faster
                        computer calculations 
                        				mean that it&#x2019;s now easier to break the encryption.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>If you want to maintain encryption strength while continuing to use RSA, one option
                        would be to increase 
                        				the size of your RSA keys. However, this approach isn&#x2019;t easily scalable because
                        using larger keys increases 
                        				the compute cost for cryptography.
                     </p>

                     <p>Alternatively, you could use an ECDSA certificate. ECDSA bases its security on a more
                        complex 
                        				mathematical problem than RSA that is harder to solve, which means that it takes
                        more computer processing time to 
                        				break ECDSA encryption. ECDSA is built on the principle that it is difficult to
                        solve for the discrete 
                        				logarithm of a random elliptic curve when its base is known, also known as the
                        Elliptic Curve Discrete 
                        				Logarithm Problem (ECDLP). This means that you can use shorter key lengths to
                        achieve the equivalent 
                        				security of using RSA with much larger key sizes.
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>In addition to providing better security, using ECDSA&apos;s smaller keys enables faster
                        computing of 
                        				algorithms, smaller digital certificates, and fewer bits to transmit during the
                        SSL/TLS handshake. As a 
                        				result, the smaller keys reduce the time that it takes for you to create and sign
                        digital certificates for 
                        				SSL/TLS termination on origin servers. Using a smaller key size therefore can
                        increase throughput by 
                        				reducing the compute cycles needed for cryptography, freeing up server resources
                        to process other 
                        				work.

                     <p>CloudFront continues to support RSA for SSL/TLS connections. However, if you have
                        concerns about the strength 
                        				of your current encryption for SSL/TLS authentication for your origin servers,
                        ECDSA could be a better 
                        				option. The effort to enable ECDSA digital certificates compared to the security
                        benefit that ECDSA 
                        				brings is a trade-off that you will have to weigh in making your decision. In
                        addition to enabling 
                        				stronger encryption, the reduction in computational cost of cryptography while
                        using ECDSA at your 
                        				origin servers is an added advantage.
