                        content. This 
                        			overview includes both the steps you perform before your first user accesses your
                        application 
                        			or website, and how CloudFront serves your content when viewers request it.

                              					such as a web server. Your HTTP server can run on an Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
                              (Amazon EC2) instance or on a 
                              					server that you manage; these servers are also known as <em>custom

                              					can be anything that can be served over HTTP or a supported version of Adobe

                        			indicate how long you want the files to stay in the cache in CloudFront edge locations.
                        By default,

                     <p>CloudFront edge locations make sure that popular content can be served quickly to
                        your viewers. CloudFront also has
                        				regional edge caches that bring more of your content closer to your viewers, even
                        when the 
                        				content is not popular enough to stay at a CloudFront edge location, to help improve
                        performance 
                        				for that content.
                     </p> 
                     			
                     <p>Regional edge caches help with all types of content, particularly content that tends
                        to become 
                        				less popular over time. Examples include user-generated content, such as video,
                        photos, or 
                        				artwork; e-commerce assets such as product photos and videos; and news and event-related
                        
                        				content that might suddenly find new popularity.

                     <p class="title"><b>How Regional Caches Work</b></p> 
                     				
                     <p>Regional edge caches are CloudFront locations that are deployed globally, close
                        					to your viewers. They&apos;re located between your origin server and the global edge
                        
                        					locations that serve content directly to viewers. As objects become less popular,
                        					individual edge locations may remove those objects to make room for more popular
                        
                        					content. Regional edge caches have a larger cache than an individual edge location,
                        so 
                        					objects remain in the cache longer at the nearest regional edge cache location.
                        This helps 
                        					keep more of your content closer to your viewers, reducing the need for CloudFront
                        to go back to 
                        					your origin server, and improving overall performance for viewers. 
                     </p> 
                     			 
                     			
                     <p>When a viewer makes a request on your website or through your application, DNS routes
                        the request 
                        				to the CloudFront edge location that can best serve the user&#x2019;s request. This location
                        is typically 
                        				the nearest CloudFront edge location in terms of latency. In the edge location,
                        CloudFront checks its 
                        				cache for the requested files. If the files are in the cache, CloudFront returns
                        them to the user. 
                        				If the files are not in the cache, the edge servers go to the nearest regional
                        edge cache to 
                        				fetch the object. 
                     </p> 
                     			
                     <p>In the regional edge cache location, CloudFront again checks its cache for the 
                        				requested files. If the files are in the cache, CloudFront forwards the files
                        to the requested edge 
                        				location. As soon as the first byte arrives from regional edge cache location,
                        CloudFront begins to 
                        				forward the files to the user. CloudFront also adds the files to the cache in
                        the requested edge 
                        				location for the next time someone requests those files. 
                     </p>
                     			
                     <p>For files not cached at both the edge location and the regional edge cache location,
                        CloudFront 
                        				compares the request with the specifications in your distributions and forwards
                        the request 
                        				for your files to the origin server. After your origin server sends the files
                        
                        				back to the regional edge cache location, they are forwarded to the requested
                        edge 
                        				location, and CloudFront forwards the files to the user. In this case, CloudFront
                        also 
                        				adds the files to the cache in the regional edge cache location in addition to
                        the edge 
                        				location for the next time a viewer requests those files. This makes sure that
                        all of the edge
                        				locations in a region share a local cache, eliminating multiple requests to origin
                        servers. CloudFront 
                        				also keeps persistent connections with origin servers so files are fetched from
                        the origins as 
                        				quickly as possible.

                                 <p>Regional edge caches have feature parity with edge locations. For example, a cache

                                    							before it expires. The next time a viewer requests the object, CloudFront returns
                                    to the 
                                    							origin to fetch the latest version of the object.
