                     <p> Amazon API Gateway is an AWS service that enables developers to create, publish,
                        maintain,
                        monitor, and secure APIs at any scale. You can create APIs that access AWS or other
                        web
                        services, as well as data stored in the <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/what-is-cloud-computing/" target="_blank">AWS Cloud</a>.

                     <p>API Gateway can be considered a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backplane" target="_blank">backplane</a> in the cloud to connect <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">AWS
                           services</a> and other public or private websites. It provides consistent
                        RESTful application programming interfaces (APIs) for mobile and web applications
                        to
                        access AWS services. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The following diagram shows API Gateway architecture. </p>
                     
                     
                     <div class="mediaobject">

                     <p> In practical terms, API Gateway lets you create, configure, and host a <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/rest-api/" target="_blank">RESTful API</a> to enable applications to
                        access the AWS Cloud. For example, an application can call an API in API Gateway to
                        upload a
                        user&apos;s annual income and expense data to <a href="./AmazonS3/latest/dev/welcome.html" target="_blank">Amazon Simple Storage Service</a> or 
                        <a href="./amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/welcome.html" target="_blank">Amazon DynamoDB</a>, process the data in
                        <a href="./lambda/latest/dg/welcome.html" target="_blank">AWS Lambda</a> to compute tax owed, and file a tax return via the IRS website. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>As shown in the diagram, an app (or client application) gains programmatic access
                        to AWS
                        services, or a website on the internet, through one or more APIs, which are hosted
                        in
                        API Gateway. The app is at the API&apos;s frontend. The integrated AWS services and websites
                        are
                        located at the API&apos;s backend. In API Gateway, the frontend is encapsulated by <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/method/" target="_blank">method requests</a> and <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/method-response/" target="_blank">method responses</a>, and the
                        backend is encapsulated by <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/integration/" target="_blank">integration
                           requests</a> and <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/integration-response/" target="_blank">integration responses</a>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>With Amazon API Gateway, you can build an API to provide your users with an integrated
                        and
                        consistent developer experience to build AWS cloud-based applications. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     <h3 id="api-gateway-overview-a-serverless-pillar">Part of AWS Serverless
                        Infrastructure
                     </h3>
                     
                     <p> Together with AWS Lambda, API Gateway forms the app-facing part of the AWS serverless
                        infrastructure. For an app to call publicly available AWS services, you can use
                        Lambda to interact with the required services and expose the Lambda functions through
                        API methods in API Gateway. AWS Lambda runs the code on a highly available computing
                        infrastructure. It performs the necessary execution and administration of the
                        computing resources. To enable the serverless applications, API Gateway supports <a href="api-gateway-set-up-simple-proxy.html">streamlined proxy integrations</a>
                        with AWS Lambda and HTTP endpoints. 
                     </p>
                     
                     
                     
                     <h2 id="api-gateway-overview-developer-experience">Developer Experiences</h2>
                     
                     <p>There are two kinds of developers who use API Gateway: app developers and API
                        developers.
                     </p> 
                     
                     <p>An app developer builds a functioning application to call AWS services
                        by invoking API methods in API Gateway.

                     <p>An API developer creates and deploys an API to enable the required
                        functionality in API Gateway. The API developer must be an IAM user in the AWS account
                        that owns the API.
                     </p> 
                     
                     <p>The app developer does not need to have an AWS account, provided
                        that the API either does not require IAM permissions or supports authorization of
                        users through
                        third-party identity providers supported by <a href="./cognito/latest/developerguide/cognito-identity.html" target="_blank">Amazon Cognito identity federation</a>. Such
                        identity providers include Amazon, Amazon Cognito User Pools, Facebook, and Google.

                     <h3 id="api-gateway-overview-developer-experience-managing-api">Creating and
                        Managing an API Gateway API
                     </h3>
                     
                     <p>An API developer works with the API Gateway service component for API management,
                        named
                        <code class="code">apigateway</code>, to create, configure, and deploy an API. Each API
                        includes a set of resources and methods. A resource is a logical entity that an app
                        can access through a resource path. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, <code class="code">/incomes</code> could be the path of a resource representing the
                        income of the app user. A resource can have one or more operations that are defined
                        by appropriate HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. A combination
                        of a resource path and an operation identifies a method of the API. For example, a
                        <code class="code">POST /incomes</code> method could add an income earned by the caller, and a
                        <code class="code">GET /expenses</code> method could query the reported expenses incurred by the
                        caller. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A method corresponds to a REST API request that is submitted by the user of your
                        API and the response returned to the user. The app does not need to know where the
                        requested data is stored and fetched from on the backend. The API interfaces with
                        the backend by 
                        means of <em>integration requests</em> and <em>integration responses</em>. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>For example, with DynamoDB as the backend, the API developer sets up the integration
                        request to forward the incoming method request to the chosen backend. The setup
                        includes specifications of an appropriate DynamoDB action, required IAM role and
                        policies, and required input data transformation. The backend returns the result to
                        API Gateway as an integration response. To route the integration response to an
                        appropriate method response (of a given HTTP status code) to the client, you can
                        configure the integration response to map required response parameters from
                        integration to method. You then translate the output data format of the backend to
                        that of the frontend, if necessary. API Gateway enables you to define a schema or
                        model
                        for the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payload_(computing)" target="_blank">payload
                           </a> to facilitate setting up the body mapping template.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p> As an API developer, you can create and manage an API by using the API Gateway console,
                        described in <a href="getting-started.html">Getting Started with Amazon API Gateway</a>, or by calling the <a href="api-ref.html">API Gateway REST API</a>. There are several ways to call this
                        API. They include using the AWS Command-Line Interface (CLI), or by using an AWS
                        SDK. You can also use a REST API client, such as Postman, to make raw API calls. In
                        addition, you can enable API creation with <a href="./AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/template-reference.html" target="_blank">AWS CloudFormation templates</a> or <a href="api-gateway-swagger-extensions.html">API Gateway Extensions to Swagger</a>.

                        are
                        several ways to call such an API. You can use the API Gateway console to test invoking
                        the
                        API. You can use a REST API client, such as CURL or Postman, or an SDK generated by
                        API Gateway for the API to invoke the API.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>Be aware of the differences between the <code class="code">apigateway</code> and

                        built internally or by third-party ecosystem partners. The business logic behind the
                        APIs can be provided by a publicly accessible endpoint that API Gateway proxies call,
                        or it
                        can be entirely run as a Lambda function.
