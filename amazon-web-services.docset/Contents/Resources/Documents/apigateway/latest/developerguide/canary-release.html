                     <p><a href="https://martinfowler.com/bliki/CanaryRelease.html" target="_blank">Canary release</a> is a
                        software development strategy in which a new version of an API (as well as other software)
                        is deployed as a canary release for testing purposes, and the base version remains
                        deployed
                        as a production release for normal operations on the same stage. For purposes of discussion,
                        we refer to the base version as a production release in this documentation. Although
                        this is
                        reasonable, you are free to apply canary release on any non-production version for
                        testing.
                     </p>
                     <p>In a canary release deployment, total API traffic is separated at random into a production
                        release and a canary release with a pre-configured ratio. Typically, the canary release
                        receives a small percentage of API traffic and the production release takes up the
                        rest. The
                        updated API features are only visible to API traffic through the canary. You can adjust
                        the
                        canary traffic percentage to optimize test coverage or performance. 
                     </p>
                     <p>By keeping canary traffic small and the selection random, most users are not adversely
                        affected at any time by potential bugs in the new version, and no single user is adversely
                        affected all the time.
                     </p>
                     <p>After the test metrics pass your requirements, you can promote the canary release
                        to the
                        production release and disable the canary from the deployment. This makes the new
                        features
                        available in the production stage.

                     <p> In API Gateway, a canary release deployment uses the deployment stage for the production
                        release of the base version of an API, and attaches to the stage a canary release
                        for
                        the new versions, relative to the base version, of the API. The stage is associated
                        with
                        the initial deployment and the canary with subsequent deployments. At the beginning,
                        both the stage and the canary point to the same API version. We use stage and production
                        release interchangeably and use canary and canary release interchangeably throughout
                        this section.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>To deploy an API with a canary release, you create a canary release deployment by
                        adding <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/#canarySettings" target="_blank">canary settings</a>
                        to the <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/stage/" target="_blank">stage</a> of a regular <a href="./apigateway/api-reference/resource/deployment/" target="_blank">deployment</a>. The canary settings
                        describe the underlying canary release and the stage represents the production release
                        of the API within this deployment. To add canary settings, set
                        <code class="code">canarySettings</code> on the deployment stage and specify the following: 
                     </p>

                                 set and API caching is enabled on the stage.
                              </p>

                     <p> After a canary release is enabled, the deployment stage cannot be associated with
                        another non-canary release deployment until the canary release is disabled and the
                        canary settings removed from the stage. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When you enable API execution logging, the canary release has its own logs and metrics
                        generated for all canary requests. They are reported to a production stage CloudWatch
                        Logs log
                        group as well as a canary-specific CloudWatch Logs log group. The same applies to
                        access logging.
                        The separate canary-specific logs are helpful to validate new API changes and decide
                        whether to accept the changes and promote the canary release to the production stage,
                        or
                        to discard the changes and revert the canary release from the production stage.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>The production stage execution log group is named
                        <code class="code">API-Gateway-Execution-Logs/<em class="replaceable"><code>{rest-api-id}</code></em>/<em class="replaceable"><code>{stage-name}</code></em></code>
                        and the canary release execution log group is named
                        <code class="code">API-Gateway-Execution-Logs/<em class="replaceable"><code>{rest-api-id}</code></em>/<em class="replaceable"><code>{stage-name}</code></em>/Canary</code>.
                        For access logging, you must create a new log group or choose an existing one. The
                        canary release access log group name has the <code class="code">/Canary</code> suffix appended to the
                        selected log group name. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>A canary release can use the stage cache, if enabled, to store responses and use
                        cached entries to return results to the next canary requests, within a pre-configured
                        time-to-live (TTL) period. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>In a canary release deployment, the production release and canary release of the API
                        can be associated with the same version or with different versions. When they are
                        associated with different versions, responses for production and canary requests are
                        cached separately and the stage cache returns corresponding results for production
                        and
                        canary requests. When the production release and canary release are associated with
                        the
                        same deployment, the stage cache uses a single cache key for both types of requests
                        and
                        returns the same response for the same requests from the production release and canary
                        release. 
                     </p>
