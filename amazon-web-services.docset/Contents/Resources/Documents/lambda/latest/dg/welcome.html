                     <p>
                        AWS Lambda is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing
                        servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when
                        needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second.
                        You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when
                        your code is not running. With AWS Lambda, you can run code for virtually any type
                        of application or backend service - all with zero administration. 
                        AWS Lambda runs your code on a high-availability compute infrastructure and performs
                        all of the administration of the compute resources,
                        including server and operating system maintenance, capacity provisioning and automatic
                        scaling, code monitoring and logging. 
                        All you need to do is supply your code in one of the languages that AWS Lambda supports
                        (currently Node.js, Java, C#, Go and Python). 
                        
                     </p>
                     <p>You can use AWS Lambda to run your code in response to events, such as changes to
                        data in an Amazon S3 bucket or an Amazon DynamoDB table; to run your code
                        in response to HTTP requests using Amazon API Gateway; or invoke your code using API
                        calls made using AWS SDKs.
                        With these capabilities, you can use Lambda to easily build data processing triggers
                        for AWS services like Amazon S3 and Amazon DynamoDB
                        process streaming data stored in Kinesis, or create your own back end that operates
                        at AWS scale, performance, and security.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also build <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/serverless" target="_blank">serverless</a> applications composed of functions that are triggered by events and automatically
                        deploy them using AWS CodePipeline and AWS CodeBuild. For
                        more information, see <a href="deploying-lambda-apps.html">Deploying Lambda-based Applications</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>For more information about the AWS Lambda execution
                        environment, see <a href="current-supported-versions.html">Lambda Execution Environment and Available
                           Libraries</a>. For information about how AWS Lambda
                        determines compute resources required to execute your code, see <a href="resource-model.html">Configuring Lambda Functions</a>.

                     <h2 id="when-to-use-cloud-functions">When Should I Use AWS Lambda?</h2>
                     
                     
                     
                     <p>AWS Lambda is an ideal compute platform for many application scenarios, provided that
                        you can
                        write your application code in languages supported by AWS Lambda (that is, Node.js,
                        Java, Go and C# and
                        Python), and run within the AWS Lambda standard runtime environment and resources
                        provided by Lambda. 
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>When using AWS Lambda, you are responsible only for your code. AWS Lambda manages
                        the
                        compute fleet that offers a balance of memory, CPU, network, and other resources.
                        This
                        is in exchange for flexibility, which means you cannot log in to compute instances,
                        or
                        customize the operating system or language runtime. These constraints enable AWS Lambda
                        to perform operational and administrative activities on your behalf, including
                        provisioning capacity, monitoring fleet health, applying security patches, deploying
                        your code, and monitoring and logging your Lambda functions.
                     </p>
                     
                     <p>If you need to manage your own compute resources, Amazon Web Services also offers
                        other compute
                        services to meet your needs. 
                     </p>

                                 are core concepts you should be familiar with.
                                 This section explains these concepts and provides details of how they work in different
